# INFS605-Assignment2-Starter-Files
This is a starter application for a BCIS second-year INFS605 Microservices programming assignment. It includes a containerized student-profile service (Python + Flask), a PostgreSQL database, and docker-compose.yml. Students are to extend the system by adding their own microservices and deploying a small-scale distributed application.
