# INFS605-Assignment2-Starter-Files
This is a starter application for a BCIS second-year INFS605 Microservices programming assignment. It includes a containerized student-profile service (Python + Flask), a PostgreSQL database, a React (Vite) admin UI to list/search/add/delete students and record attendance and docker-compose.yml. Students are invited to extend the system by adding their own microservices and deploying a small-scale distributed application.

## Microservices Assignment Starter

This repository provides a starter  application for your programming assignment in the INFS605 Microservices course (BCIS Year 2).

You are provided with:
- A `student-profile` microservice built in Flask
- A PostgreSQL container for persistence
- A shared `docker-compose.yml` to deploy services
- a React (Vite) Admin user UI

Technologies used:
- Python + Flask
- Docker + Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- React

Your task is to build additional microservices, connect them using Docker Compose, and demonstrate a small, functional microservices architecture with clear service boundaries.

Start small, and iterate!

You can use this as a starting point for your assignment and consider adding further services – a Course Catalog Service, a Feedback Service, a Notification Service, a Grades Service (that can store and retrieve grades for students and courses), a Timetable Service (that can show weekly schedules for students or lecturers) an Assignment Tracker (shows coming and submitted assignments), a Room Booking Service (for team meetings), or come more generic services such as – an Image Upload Service, a Search Service, a Logging or Audit Trail Service, Frontend UI, PDF Generator, System Metrics Service.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker-Compose 
- Python (if running services outside of Docker)
[If on Ubuntu: sudo apt install docker-compose]
[If on Ubuntu: sudo snap install docker]

### 2. Building and running the System
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Then go make a cup of tea or do some cardio while it builds, installs and runs. 

- API: http://localhost:5001
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### 3. Running the System on VirtualBox

You could use the same Ubuntu server runnin on the same virtual machine you used in the INFS605 class. create a new "assignment2" folder extract the contents of the zip file or cloned repository from GitHub into your new assignment2 folder. 

If you are using VirtualBox to host your application on Ubuntu you will need to set up Port Forwarding Rules to allow your services to run on Localhost port 5001. In Machine/Settings (and in Expert mode) under Network set a new protocol with TCP Host Port 5001 and Guest Port 5001. That will map port 5001 in the student-services container to port 5001 of your browser for the API. Then set another new protocol with TCP Host Port 3000 and Guest Port 3000. That will map port 3000 in the admin-frontend container to port 3000 of your browser. 

For the React frontend to work you will also need to install the Node Package Manager (npm) on your Ubuntu server running on the virtual machine:

sudo apt install nodejs npm -y

[enter your password]
[the password is "microservices" if you are using the VM from the INFS605 tutorial class]

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Student Profile Service (http://localhost:5001)
- `GET /students` – list all students
- `GET /students/:id` – get a student
- `POST /students` – `{ name, email }`
- `PUT /students/:id` – update `{ name?, email? }`
- `DELETE /students/:id`
- `POST /students/:id/attendance` – `{ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', status: 'Present|Absent|Late|Excused' }`

## Environment Variables

- DB URL is passed via `DATABASE_URL` inside docker-compose.
- Postgres is seeded from `student-profile/init.sql` on first startup (volume-less).

[Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if needed.]

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or screen recordings as you compose, run and test the system. Especially capture any errors you encounter and note how you resolved them.

## Troubleshooting containers

If you have trouble stoppong containers with docker-compose-down then you might have some permission errors if you are running as admin from root and the container network endpoints are running with local users.
Docker refusing to kill a container. It usually happens because:
- The Docker daemon is running as root, but your user doesn’t have the right privileges.
- The container is in a bad / zombie state (hung process inside).
- You’re in a VM (VirtualBox Ubuntu) and Docker sometimes glitches with cgroups. 

1. Use sudo (superuser do)
sudo docker stop assignment_frontend_1
sudo docker rm assignment_frontend_1

2. Force kill
sudo docker rm -f assignment_frontend_1

3. Kill via container process ID (PID)
Find the process PID: 
sudo docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' assignment_frontend_1
Then kill it manually:
sudo kill -9 <pid>

Find any other container service IDs and repeat the above:
ps aux | grep containerd-shim

4. Restart the entire Docker service
sudo systemctl restart docker

5. Delete the entire virtual machine and reboot
After cleanup 
docker ps -a   # should be empty
docker-compose up -d --build
