  The DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser this document is HTML5.
  Without this line, browsers can switch into an older "quirks mode"
  and interpret HTML/CSS incorrectly.

  <head>
    <!--
      The <head> section contains meta information *about* the page —
      not the content the user sees.
      React/Vite injects compiled scripts and metadata here when the app builds.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--
      The charset defines how characters are encoded — UTF-8 supports
      almost all world languages (including Māori, Chinese, etc.)
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--
      The viewport tag ensures the layout adapts correctly on mobile devices.
      It sets the page width to match the device width and initial zoom to 1.
    -->
    <title>Student Admin Portal</title>
    <!--
      The title appears in the browser tab or window title bar.
      When this app runs inside Docker, students will see
      "Student Admin Portal" when visiting http://localhost:3000

  <body>
    <!--
      The <body> contains the actual visible page content.
      Here we only have an empty <div id="root"> — this is intentional.
      React takes over this root div tag at runtime. The "root" div acts as
      a placeholder or mounting point where the React component tree
      is dynamically rendered by JavaScript.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!--
      This script loads the entry point for the React/Vite application.
      - "type='module'" tells the browser to use modern ES Modules syntax.
      - "/src/main.jsx" is the file where ReactDOM.render() (or createRoot)
        attaches the React app to the <div id="root"> above.
      When the Vite dev server runs, it automatically serves this file
      and handles live reloading as you save changes.

    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
